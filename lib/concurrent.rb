# @!macro [new] monotonic_clock_warning
# 
#   @note Time calculations one all platforms and languages are sensitive to
#     changes to the system clock. To alleviate the potential problems
#     associated with changing the system clock while an application is running,
#     most modern operating systems provide a monotonic clock that operates
#     independently of the system clock. A monotonic clock cannot be used to
#     determine human-friendly clock times. A monotonic clock is used exclusively
#     for calculating time intervals. Not all Ruby platforms provide access to an
#     operating system monotonic clock. On these platforms a pure-Ruby monotonic
#     clock will be used as a fallback. An operating system monotonic clock is both
#     faster and more reliable than the pure-Ruby implementation. The pure-Ruby
#     implementation should be fast and reliable enough for most non-realtime
#     operations. At this time the common Ruby platforms that provide access to an
#     operating system monotonic clock are MRI 2.1 and above and JRuby (all versions).
#

# Modern concurrency tools for Ruby. Inspired by Erlang, Clojure, Scala, Haskell,
# F#, C#, Java, and classic concurrency patterns.
# 
# The design goals of this gem are:
# 
# * Stay true to the spirit of the languages providing inspiration
# * But implement in a way that makes sense for Ruby
# * Keep the semantics as idiomatic Ruby as possible
# * Support features that make sense in Ruby
# * Exclude features that don't make sense in Ruby
# * Be small, lean, and loosely coupled
