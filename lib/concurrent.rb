# Modern concurrency tools for Ruby. Inspired by Erlang, Clojure, Scala, Haskell,
# F#, C#, Java, and classic concurrency patterns.
# 
# The design goals of this gem are:
# 
# * Stay true to the spirit of the languages providing inspiration
# * But implement in a way that makes sense for Ruby
# * Keep the semantics as idiomatic Ruby as possible
# * Support features that make sense in Ruby
# * Exclude features that don't make sense in Ruby
# * Be small, lean, and loosely coupled
