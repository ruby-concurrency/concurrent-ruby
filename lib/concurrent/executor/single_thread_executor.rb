  # @!macro [attach] single_thread_executor
  #
  #   A thread pool with a set number of threads. The number of threads in the pool
  #   is set on construction and remains constant. When all threads are busy new
  #   tasks `#post` to the thread pool are enqueued until a thread becomes available.
  #   Should a thread crash for any reason the thread will immediately be removed
  #   from the pool and replaced.
  #
  #   The API and behavior of this class are based on Java's `SingleThreadExecutor`
