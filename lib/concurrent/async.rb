module Concurrent

  # A mixin module that provides simple asynchronous behavior to any standard
  # class/object or object. 
  #
  #   Scenario:
  #     As a stateful, plain old Ruby class/object
  #     I want safe, asynchronous behavior
  #     So my long-running methods don't block the main thread
  #
  # Stateful, mutable objects must be managed carefully when used asynchronously.
  # But Ruby is an object-oriented language so designing with objects and classes
  # plays to Ruby's strengths and is often more natural to many Ruby programmers.
  # The `Async` module is a way to mix simple yet powerful asynchronous capabilities
  # into any plain old Ruby object or class. These capabilities provide a reasonable
  # level of thread safe guarantees when used correctly.
  #
  # When this module is mixed into a class or object it provides to new methods:
  # `async` and `await`. These methods are thread safe with respect to the enclosing
  # object. The former method allows methods to be called asynchronously by posting
  # to the global thread pool. The latter allows a method to be called synchronously
  # on the current thread but does so safely with respect to any pending asynchronous
  # method calls. Both methods return an `Obligation` which can be inspected for
  # the result of the method call. Calling a method with `async` will return a
  # `:pending` `Obligation` whereas `await` will return a `:complete` `Obligation`.
  #
  # Very loosely based on the `async` and `await` keywords in C#.
  #
  # @example Defining an asynchronous class
  #   class Echo
  #     include Concurrent::Async
  #
  #     def initialize
  #       init_mutex # initialize the internal synchronization objects
  #     end
  #
  #     def echo(msg)
  #       sleep(rand)
  #       print "#{msg}\n"
  #       nil
  #     end
  #   end
  #   
  #   horn = Echo.new
  #   horn.echo('zero') # synchronous, not thread-safe
  #
  #   horn.async.echo('one') # asynchronous, non-blocking, thread-safe
  #   horn.await.echo('two') # synchronous, blocking, thread-safe
  #
  # @example Monkey-patching an existing object
  #   numbers = 1_000_000.times.collect{ rand }
  #   numbers.extend(Concurrent::Async)
  #   numbers.init_mutex # initialize the internal synchronization objects
  #   
  #   future = numbers.async.max
  #   future.state #=> :pending
  #   
  #   sleep(2)
  #   
  #   future.state #=> :fulfilled
  #   future.value #=> 0.999999138918843
  #
  # @note This module depends on several internal synchronization objects that
  #       must be initialized prior to calling any of the async/await/executor methods.
  #       The best practice is to call `init_mutex` from within the constructor
  #       of the including class. A less ideal but acceptable practice is for the
  #       thread creating the asynchronous object to explicitly call the `init_mutex`
  #       method prior to calling any of the async/await/executor methods. If
  #       `init_mutex` is *not* called explicitly the async/await/executor methods
  #       will attempt to lazily initialize the internal synchronization objects, but
  #       thread-safe initialization cannot be guaranteed.
  #
  # @note Thread safe guarantees can only be made when asynchronous method calls
  #       are not mixed with synchronous method calls. Use only synchronous calls
  #       when the object is used exclusively on a single thread. Use only
  #       `async` and `await` when the object is shared between threads. Once you
  #       call a method using `async`, you should no longer call any methods
  #       directly on the object. Use `async` and `await` exclusively from then on.
  #       With careful programming it is possible to switch back and forth but it's
  #       also very easy to create race conditions and break your application.
  #       Basically, it's "async all the way down."
