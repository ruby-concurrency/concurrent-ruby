module Concurrent

  # A submodule for unstable, highly experimental features that are likely to
  # change often and which may never become part of the core gem. Also for
  # new, experimental version of abstractions already in the core gem.
  #
  # Most new features should start in this module, clearly indicating the
  # experimental and unstable nature of the feature. Once a feature becomes
  # more stable and is a candidate for inclusion in the core gem it should
  # be moved up to the `Concurrent` module, where it would reside once merged
  # into the core gem.
  #
  # The only exception to this is for features which *replace* features from
  # the core gem in ways that are breaking and not backward compatible. These
  # features should remain in this module until merged into the core gem. This
  # will prevent namespace collisions.
  #
  # This file should *never* be used as a global `require` for all files within
  # the edge gem. Because these features are experimental users should always
  # explicitly require only what they need.
