  # Condition is a better implementation of standard Ruby ConditionVariable. The
  # biggest difference is the wait return value: Condition#wait returns
  # Condition::Result which make possible to know if waiting thread has been
  # woken up by an another thread (using #signal or #broadcast) or due to
  # timeout.
  #
  # Every #wait must be guarded by a locked Mutex or a ThreadError will be
  # risen. Although it's not mandatory, it's recommended to call also #signal
  # and #broadcast within the same mutex
  #
  # @deprecated
