  # @!macro [attach] count_down_latch
  #
  #   A synchronization object that allows one thread to wait on multiple other threads.
  #   The thread that will wait creates a `CountDownLatch` and sets the initial value
  #   (normally equal to the number of other threads). The initiating thread passes the
  #   latch to the other threads then waits for the other threads by calling the `#wait`
  #   method. Each of the other threads calls `#count_down` when done with its work.
  #   When the latch counter reaches zero the waiting thread is unblocked and continues
  #   with its work. A `CountDownLatch` can be used only once. Its value cannot be reset.
