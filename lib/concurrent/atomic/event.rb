  # @!macro [attach] event
  #
  #   Old school kernel-style event reminiscent of Win32 programming in C++.
  #
  #   When an `Event` is created it is in the `unset` state. Threads can choose to
  #   `#wait` on the event, blocking until released by another thread. When one
  #   thread wants to alert all blocking threads it calls the `#set` method which
  #   will then wake up all listeners. Once an `Event` has been set it remains set.
  #   New threads calling `#wait` will return immediately. An `Event` may be
  #   `#reset` at any time once it has been set.
