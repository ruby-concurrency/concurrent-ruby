  # Ruby read-write lock implementation
  #
  # Allows any number of concurrent readers, but only one concurrent writer
  # (And if the "write" lock is taken, any readers who come along will have to wait)
  #
  # If readers are already active when a writer comes along, the writer will wait for
  # all the readers to finish before going ahead.
  # Any additional readers that come when the writer is already waiting, will also
  # wait (so writers are not starved).
  #
  # This implementation is based on `java.util.concurrent.ReentrantReadWriteLock`.
  #
  # @example
  #   lock = Concurrent::ReadWriteLock.new
  #   lock.with_read_lock  { data.retrieve }
  #   lock.with_write_lock { data.modify! }
  #
  # @note Do **not** try to acquire the write lock while already holding a read lock
  #   **or** try to acquire the write lock while you already have it.
  #   This will lead to deadlock
  #
  # @see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantReadWriteLock.html java.util.concurrent.ReentrantReadWriteLock

    # Implementation notes: 
    # A goal is to make the uncontended path for both readers/writers lock-free
    # Only if there is reader-writer or writer-writer contention, should locks be used
    # Internal state is represented by a single integer ("counter"), and updated 
    #  using atomic compare-and-swap operations
    # When the counter is 0, the lock is free
    # Each reader increments the counter by 1 when acquiring a read lock
    #   (and decrements by 1 when releasing the read lock)
    # The counter is increased by (1 << 15) for each writer waiting to acquire the
    #   write lock, and by (1 << 30) if the write lock is taken

    # Create a new `ReadWriteLock` in the unlocked state.
