  # Promises are inspired by the JavaScript [Promises/A](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A)
  # and [Promises/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/) specifications.
  #
  # > A promise represents the eventual value returned from the single
  # > completion of an operation.
  #
  # Promises are similar to futures and share many of the same behaviours.
  # Promises are far more robust, however. Promises can be chained in a tree
  # structure where each promise may have zero or more children. Promises are
  # chained using the `then` method. The result of a call to `then` is always
  # another promise. Promises are resolved asynchronously (with respect to the
  # main thread) but in a strict order: parents are guaranteed to be resolved
  # before their children, children before their younger siblings. The `then`
  # method takes two parameters: an optional block to be executed upon parent
  # resolution and an optional callable to be executed upon parent failure. The
  # result of each promise is passed to each of its children upon resolution.
  # When a promise is rejected all its children will be summarily rejected and
  # will receive the reason.
  #
  # Promises have four possible states: *unscheduled*, *pending*, *rejected*,
  # and *fulfilled*. A Promise created using `.new` will be *unscheduled*. It is
  # scheduled by calling the `execute` method. Upon execution the Promise and
  # all its children will be set to *pending*. When a promise is *pending* it
  # will remain in that state until processing is complete. A completed Promise
  # is either *rejected*, indicating that an exception was thrown during
  # processing, or *fulfilled*, indicating it succeeded. If a Promise is
  # *fulfilled* its `value` will be updated to reflect the result of the
  # operation. If *rejected* the `reason` will be updated with a reference to
  # the thrown exception. The predicate methods `unscheduled?`, `pending?`,
  # `rejected?`, and `fulfilled?` can be called at any time to obtain the state
  # of the Promise, as can the `state` method, which returns a symbol. A Promise
  # created using `.execute` will be *pending*, a Promise created using
  # `.fulfill(value)` will be *fulfilled* with the given value and a Promise
  # created using `.reject(reason)` will be *rejected* with the given reason.
  #
  # Retrieving the value of a promise is done through the `value` (alias:
  # `deref`) method. Obtaining the value of a promise is a potentially blocking
  # operation. When a promise is *rejected* a call to `value` will return `nil`
  # immediately. When a promise is *fulfilled* a call to `value` will
  # immediately return the current value. When a promise is *pending* a call to
  # `value` will block until the promise is either *rejected* or *fulfilled*. A
  # *timeout* value can be passed to `value` to limit how long the call will
  # block. If `nil` the call will block indefinitely. If `0` the call will not
  # block. Any other integer or float value will indicate the maximum number of
  # seconds to block.
  #
  # Promises run on the global thread pool.
  #
  # ### Examples
  #
  # Start by requiring promises
  #
  # ```ruby
  # require 'concurrent'
  # ```
  #
  # Then create one
  #
  # ```ruby
  # p = Concurrent::Promise.execute do
  #       # do something
  #       42
  #     end
  # ```
  #
  # Promises can be chained using the `then` method. The `then` method accepts a
  # block, to be executed on fulfillment, and a callable argument to be executed
  # on rejection. The result of the each promise is passed as the block argument
  # to chained promises.
  #
  # ```ruby
  # p = Concurrent::Promise.new{10}.then{|x| x * 2}.then{|result| result - 10 }.execute
  # ```
  #
  # And so on, and so on, and so on...
  #
  # ```ruby
  # p = Concurrent::Promise.fulfill(20).
  #     then{|result| result - 10 }.
  #     then{|result| result * 3 }.
  #     then{|result| result % 5 }.execute
  # ```
  #
  # The initial state of a newly created Promise depends on the state of its parent:
  # - if parent is *unscheduled* the child will be *unscheduled*
  # - if parent is *pending* the child will be *pending*
  # - if parent is *fulfilled* the child will be *pending*
  # - if parent is *rejected* the child will be *pending* (but will ultimately be *rejected*)
  #
  # Promises are executed asynchronously from the main thread. By the time a
  # child Promise finishes nitialization it may be in a different state that its
  # parent (by the time a child is created its parent may have completed
  # execution and changed state). Despite being asynchronous, however, the order
  # of execution of Promise objects in a chain (or tree) is strictly defined.
  #
  # There are multiple ways to create and execute a new `Promise`. Both ways
  # provide identical behavior:
  #
  # ```ruby
  # # create, operate, then execute
  # p1 = Concurrent::Promise.new{ "Hello World!" }
  # p1.state #=> :unscheduled
  # p1.execute
  #
  # # create and immediately execute
  # p2 = Concurrent::Promise.new{ "Hello World!" }.execute
  #
  # # execute during creation
  # p3 = Concurrent::Promise.execute{ "Hello World!" }
  # ```
  #
  # Once the `execute` method is called a `Promise` becomes `pending`:
  #
  # ```ruby
  # p = Concurrent::Promise.execute{ "Hello, world!" }
  # p.state    #=> :pending
  # p.pending? #=> true
  # ```
  #
  # Wait a little bit, and the promise will resolve and provide a value:
  #
  # ```ruby
  # p = Concurrent::Promise.execute{ "Hello, world!" }
  # sleep(0.1)
  #
  # p.state      #=> :fulfilled
  # p.fulfilled? #=> true
  # p.value      #=> "Hello, world!"
  # ```
  #
  # If an exception occurs, the promise will be rejected and will provide
  # a reason for the rejection:
  #
  # ```ruby
  # p = Concurrent::Promise.execute{ raise StandardError.new("Here comes the Boom!") }
  # sleep(0.1)
  #
  # p.state     #=> :rejected
  # p.rejected? #=> true
  # p.reason    #=> "#<StandardError: Here comes the Boom!>"
  # ```
  #
  # #### Rejection
  #
  # When a promise is rejected all its children will be rejected and will
  # receive the rejection `reason` as the rejection callable parameter:
  #
  # ```ruby
  # p = [ Concurrent::Promise.execute{ Thread.pass; raise StandardError } ]
  #
  # c1 = p.then(Proc.new{ |reason| 42 })
  # c2 = p.then(Proc.new{ |reason| raise 'Boom!' })
  #
  # sleep(0.1)
  #
  # c1.state  #=> :rejected
  # c2.state  #=> :rejected
  # ```
  #
  # Once a promise is rejected it will continue to accept children that will
  # receive immediately rejection (they will be executed asynchronously).
  #
  # #### Aliases
  #
  # The `then` method is the most generic alias: it accepts a block to be
  # executed upon parent fulfillment and a callable to be executed upon parent
  # rejection. At least one of them should be passed. The default block is `{
  # |result| result }` that fulfills the child with the parent value. The
  # default callable is `{ |reason| raise reason }` that rejects the child with
  # the parent reason.
  #
  # - `on_success { |result| ... }` is the same as `then {|result| ... }`
  # - `rescue { |reason| ... }` is the same as `then(Proc.new { |reason| ... } )`
  # - `rescue` is aliased by `catch` and `on_error`
