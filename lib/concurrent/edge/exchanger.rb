    # A synchronization point at which threads can pair and swap elements within
    # pairs. Each thread presents some object on entry to the exchange method,
    # matches with a partner thread, and receives its partner's object on return.
    #
    # Uses `MVar` to manage synchronization of the individual elements.
    # Since `MVar` is also a `Dereferenceable`, the exchanged values support all
    # dereferenceable options. The constructor options hash will be passed to
    # the `MVar` constructors.
