  # Run a block that reads and writes `TVar`s as a single atomic transaction.
  # With respect to the value of `TVar` objects, the transaction is atomic, in
  # that it either happens or it does not, consistent, in that the `TVar`
  # objects involved will never enter an illegal state, and isolated, in that
  # transactions never interfere with each other. You may recognise these
  # properties from database transactions.
  #
  # There are some very important and unusual semantics that you must be aware of:
  #
  # * Most importantly, the block that you pass to atomically may be executed
  #     more than once. In most cases your code should be free of
  #     side-effects, except for via TVar.
  #
  # * If an exception escapes an atomically block it will abort the transaction.
  #
  # * It is undefined behaviour to use callcc or Fiber with atomically.
  #
  # * If you create a new thread within an atomically, it will not be part of
  #     the transaction. Creating a thread counts as a side-effect.
  #
  # Transactions within transactions are flattened to a single transaction.
  #
  # @example
  #   a = new TVar(100_000)
  #   b = new TVar(100)
  #
  #   Concurrent::atomically do
  #     a.value -= 10
  #     b.value += 10
  #   end
