<p>The design goals of this gem are:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Be an &#39;unopinionated&#39; toolbox that provides useful utilities without debating which is better 
or why</li>
<li>  Remain free of external gem dependencies</li>
<li>  Stay true to the spirit of the languages providing inspiration</li>
<li>  But implement in a way that makes sense for Ruby</li>
<li>  Keep the semantics as idiomatic Ruby as possible</li>
<li>  Support features that make sense in Ruby</li>
<li>  Exclude features that don&#39;t make sense in Ruby</li>
<li>  Be small, lean, and loosely coupled</li>
<li>  Thread-safety</li>
<li>  Backward compatibility</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p><strong>This gem depends on 
<a href="https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby/graphs/contributors">contributions</a> and we 
appreciate your help. Would you like to contribute? Great! Have a look at 
<a href="https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alooking-for-contributor">issues with <code>looking-for-contributor</code> label</a>.</strong> And if you pick something up let us know on the issue.</p>

<h2>Thread Safety</h2>

<p><em>Concurrent Ruby makes one of the strongest thread safety guarantees of any Ruby concurrency 
library, providing consistent behavior and guarantees on all three of the main Ruby interpreters 
(MRI/CRuby, JRuby, and Rubinius).</em></p>

<p>Every abstraction in this library is thread safe. Specific thread safety guarantees are documented 
with each abstraction.</p>

<p>It is critical to remember, however, that Ruby is a language of mutable references. <em>No</em>
concurrency library for Ruby can ever prevent the user from making thread safety mistakes (such as
sharing a mutable object between threads and modifying it on both threads) or from creating
deadlocks through incorrect use of locks. All the library can do is provide safe abstractions which
encourage safe practices. Concurrent Ruby provides more safe concurrency abstractions than any
other Ruby library, many of which support the mantra of 
<a href="https://blog.golang.org/share-memory-by-communicating">&quot;Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating&quot;</a>.
Concurrent Ruby is also the only Ruby library which provides a full suite of thread safe and
immutable variable types and data structures.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve also initiated discussion to document <a href="docs-source/synchronization.md">memory model</a> of Ruby which 
would provide consistent behaviour and guarantees on all three of the main Ruby interpreters 
(MRI/CRuby, JRuby, Rubinius, TruffleRuby).</p>

<h2>Features &amp; Documentation</h2>

<p><strong>The primary site for documentation is the automatically generated 
<a href="http://ruby-concurrency.github.io/concurrent-ruby/index.html">API documentation</a> which is up to 
date with latest release.</strong> This readme matches the master so may contain new stuff not yet 
released.</p>

<p>We also have a <a href="https://gitter.im/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby">IRC (gitter)</a>.</p>

<h3>Versioning</h3>

<ul>
<li>  <code>concurrent-ruby</code> uses <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a></li>
<li>  <code>concurrent-ruby-ext</code> has always same version as <code>concurrent-ruby</code></li>
<li>  <code>concurrent-ruby-edge</code> will always be 0.y.z therefore following 
<a href="http://semver.org/#spec-item-4">point 4</a> applies <em>&quot;Major version zero 
(0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The 
public API should not be considered stable.&quot;</em> However we additionally use 
following rules:

<ul>
<li>  Minor version increment means incompatible changes were made</li>
<li>  Patch version increment means only compatible changes were made</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>General-purpose Concurrency Abstractions</h4>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="http://ruby-concurrency.github.io/concurrent-ruby/master/Concurrent/Async.html">Async</a>:
A mixin module that provides simple asynchronous behavior to a class. Loosely based on Erlang&#39;s 
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/gen_server.html">gen_server</a>.</li>
<li>  <a href="http://ruby-concurrency.github.io/concurrent-ruby/master/Concurrent/ScheduledTask.html">ScheduledTask</a>:
Like a Future scheduled for a specific future time.</li>
<li>  <a href="http://ruby-concurrency.github.io/concurrent-ruby/master/Concurrent/TimerTask.html">TimerTask</a>:
A Thread that periodically wakes up to perform work at regular intervals.</li>
<li>  <a href="http://ruby-concurrency.github.io/concurrent-ruby/master/Concurrent/Promises.html">Promises</a>:
Unified implementation of futures and promises which combines features of previous <code>Future</code>,
<code>Promise</code>, <code>IVar</code>, <code>Event</code>, <code>dataflow</code>, <code>Delay</code>, and (partially) <code>TimerTask</code> into a single 
framework. It extensively uses the new synchronization layer to make all the features 
<strong>non-blocking</strong> and <strong>lock-free</strong>, with the exception of obviously blocking operations like 
<code>#wait</code>, <code>#value</code>. It also offers better performance.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>These are available in the <code>concurrent-ruby-edge</code> companion gem.</p>

<p>These features are under active development and may change frequently. They are expected not to
keep backward compatibility (there may also lack tests and documentation). Semantic versions will
be obeyed though. Features developed in <code>concurrent-ruby-edge</code> are expected to move to
<code>concurrent-ruby</code> when final.</p>

the Actor Model, where concurrent actors exchange messages.

<h2>Supported Ruby versions</h2>

<p>MRI 2.0 and above, JRuby 9000, TruffleRuby are supported. 
This gem should be fully compatible with any interpreter that is compliant with Ruby 2.0 or newer.
Java 8 is preferred for JRuby but every Java version on which JRuby 9000 runs is supported.</p>

<p>The legacy support for Rubinius is kept but it is no longer maintained, if you would like to help 
please respond to <a href="https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby/issues/739">#739</a>.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Everything within this gem can be loaded simply by requiring it:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_require'>require</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>concurrent</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p><em>Requiring only specific abstractions from Concurrent Ruby is not yet supported.</em></p>

<p>To use the tools in the Edge gem it must be required separately:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_require'>require</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>concurrent-edge</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p>If the library does not behave as expected, <code>Concurrent.use_stdlib_logger(Logger::DEBUG)</code> could 
help to reveal the problem.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<pre class="code shell"><code class="shell">gem install concurrent-ruby
</code></pre>

<p>or add the following line to Gemfile:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_gem'>gem</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>concurrent-ruby</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span><span class='comma'>,</span> <span class='label'>require:</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>concurrent</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p>and run <code>bundle install</code> from your shell.</p>

<h3>Edge Gem Installation</h3>

<p>The Edge gem must be installed separately from the core gem:</p>

<pre class="code shell"><code class="shell">gem install concurrent-ruby-edge
</code></pre>

<p>or add the following line to Gemfile:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_gem'>gem</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>concurrent-ruby-edge</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span><span class='comma'>,</span> <span class='label'>require:</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>concurrent-edge</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p>and run <code>bundle install</code> from your shell.</p>

<h3>C Extensions for MRI</h3>

<p>Potential performance improvements may be achieved under MRI by installing optional C extensions.
To minimise installation errors the C extensions are available in the <code>concurrent-ruby-ext</code>
extension gem. <code>concurrent-ruby</code> and <code>concurrent-ruby-ext</code> are always released together with same
version. Simply install the extension gem too:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_gem'>gem</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_install'>install</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_concurrent'>concurrent</span><span class='op'>-</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_ruby'>ruby</span><span class='op'>-</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_ext'>ext</span>
</code></pre>

<p>or add the following line to Gemfile:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_gem'>gem</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>concurrent-ruby-ext</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p>and run <code>bundle install</code> from your shell.</p>

<p>In code it is only necessary to</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_require'>require</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>concurrent</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>concurrent-ruby</code> gem will automatically detect the presence of the <code>concurrent-ruby-ext</code> gem
and load the appropriate C extensions.</p>

<h4>Note For gem developers</h4>

<p>No gems should depend on <code>concurrent-ruby-ext</code>. Doing so will force C extensions on your users. The
best practice is to depend on <code>concurrent-ruby</code> and let users to decide if they want C extensions.</p>

</h3><div class="docstring">

    <p>Run a block that reads and writes <code>TVar</code>s as a single atomic transaction.
With respect to the value of <code>TVar</code> objects, the transaction is atomic, in
that it either happens or it does not, consistent, in that the <code>TVar</code>
objects involved will never enter an illegal state, and isolated, in that
transactions never interfere with each other. You may recognise these
properties from database transactions.</p>

<p>There are some very important and unusual semantics that you must be aware of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most importantly, the block that you pass to atomically may be executed
more than once. In most cases your code should be free of
side-effects, except for via TVar.</p></li>
<li><p>If an exception escapes an atomically block it will abort the transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>It is undefined behaviour to use callcc or Fiber with atomically.</p></li>
<li><p>If you create a new thread within an atomically, it will not be part of
the transaction. Creating a thread counts as a side-effect.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Transactions within transactions are flattened to a single transaction.</p>

    <p>Dataflow allows you to create a task that will be scheduled when all of its data dependencies are available.
Data dependencies are <code>Future</code> values. The dataflow task itself is also a <code>Future</code> value, so you can build up a graph of these tasks, each of which is run when all the data and other tasks it depends on are available or completed. </p>

<p>Our syntax is somewhat related to that of Akka&#39;s <code>flow</code> and Habanero Java&#39;s <code>DataDrivenFuture</code>. However unlike Akka we don&#39;t schedule a task at all until it is ready to run, and unlike Habanero Java we pass the data values into the task instead of dereferencing them again in the task. </p>

<p>The theory of dataflow goes back to the 70s. In the terminology of the literature, our implementation is coarse-grained, in that each task can be many instructions, and dynamic in that you can create more tasks within other tasks. </p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>A dataflow task is created with the <code>dataflow</code> method, passing in a block.</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_task'>task</span> <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='const'><span class='object_link'><a href="" title="Concurrent (module)">Concurrent</a></span></span><span class='op'>::</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_dataflow'>dataflow</span> <span class='lbrace'>{</span> <span class='int'>14</span> <span class='rbrace'>}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This produces a simple <code>Future</code> value. The task will run immediately, as it has no dependencies. We can also specify <code>Future</code> values that must be available before a task will run. When we do this we get the value of those futures passed to our block. </p>

<p>Using the <code>dataflow</code> method you can build up a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tasks that depend on each other, and have the tasks run as soon as their dependencies are ready and there is CPU capacity to schedule them. This can help you create a program that uses more of the CPU resources available to you. </p>

<h3>Derivation</h3>

<p>This section describes how we could derive dataflow from other primitives in this library.</p>

<p>Consider a naive fibonacci calculator.</p>

<p>One of the drawbacks of this approach is that all the futures start, and then most of them immediately block on their dependencies. We know that there&#39;s no point executing those futures until their dependencies are ready, so let&#39;s not execute each future until all their dependencies are ready. </p>

<p>To do this we&#39;ll create an object that counts the number of times it observes a future finishing before it does something - and for us that something will be to execute the next future. </p>

<p>Since we know that the futures the dataflow computation depends on are already going to be available when the future is executed, we might as well pass the values into the block so we don&#39;t have to reference the futures inside the block.

independently of the system clock. A monotonic clock cannot be used to
determine human-friendly clock times. A monotonic clock is used exclusively
for calculating time intervals. Not all Ruby platforms provide access to an
operating system monotonic clock. On these platforms a pure-Ruby monotonic
clock will be used as a fallback. An operating system monotonic clock is both
faster and more reliable than the pure-Ruby implementation. The pure-Ruby
implementation should be fast and reliable enough for most non-realtime
operations. At this time the common Ruby platforms that provide access to an
operating system monotonic clock are MRI 2.1 and above and JRuby (all versions).</p>
