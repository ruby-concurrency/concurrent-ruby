    <p>Run a block that reads and writes <code>TVar</code>s as a single atomic transaction.
With respect to the value of <code>TVar</code> objects, the transaction is atomic, in
that it either happens or it does not, consistent, in that the <code>TVar</code>
objects involved will never enter an illegal state, and isolated, in that
transactions never interfere with each other. You may recognise these
properties from database transactions.</p>

<p>There are some very important and unusual semantics that you must be aware of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most importantly, the block that you pass to atomically may be executed
more than once. In most cases your code should be free of
side-effects, except for via TVar.</p></li>
<li><p>If an exception escapes an atomically block it will abort the transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>It is undefined behaviour to use callcc or Fiber with atomically.</p></li>

  <div class="discussion">
    <p>Dataflow allows you to create a task that will be scheduled when all of its data dependencies are available.
Data dependencies are <code>Future</code> values. The dataflow task itself is also a <code>Future</code> value, so you can build up a graph of these tasks, each of which is run when all the data and other tasks it depends on are available or completed. </p>

<p>Our syntax is somewhat related to that of Akka&#39;s <code>flow</code> and Habanero Java&#39;s <code>DataDrivenFuture</code>. However unlike Akka we don&#39;t schedule a task at all until it is ready to run, and unlike Habanero Java we pass the data values into the task instead of dereferencing them again in the task. </p>

<p>The theory of dataflow goes back to the 70s. In the terminology of the literature, our implementation is coarse-grained, in that each task can be many instructions, and dynamic in that you can create more tasks within other tasks. </p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>A dataflow task is created with the <code>dataflow</code> method, passing in a block.</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_task'>task</span> <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='const'><span class='object_link'><a href="" title="Concurrent (module)">Concurrent</a></span></span><span class='op'>::</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_dataflow'>dataflow</span> <span class='lbrace'>{</span> <span class='int'>14</span> <span class='rbrace'>}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This produces a simple <code>Future</code> value. The task will run immediately, as it has no dependencies. We can also specify <code>Future</code> values that must be available before a task will run. When we do this we get the value of those futures passed to our block. </p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_a'>a</span> <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='const'><span class='object_link'><a href="" title="Concurrent (module)">Concurrent</a></span></span><span class='op'>::</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_dataflow'>dataflow</span> <span class='lbrace'>{</span> <span class='int'>1</span> <span class='rbrace'>}</span>
<span class='id identifier rubyid_b'>b</span> <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='const'><span class='object_link'><a href="" title="Concurrent (module)">Concurrent</a></span></span><span class='op'>::</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_dataflow'>dataflow</span> <span class='lbrace'>{</span> <span class='int'>2</span> <span class='rbrace'>}</span>
<span class='id identifier rubyid_c'>c</span> <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='const'><span class='object_link'><a href="" title="Concurrent (module)">Concurrent</a></span></span><span class='op'>::</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_dataflow'>dataflow</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_a'>a</span><span class='comma'>,</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_b'>b</span><span class='rparen'>)</span> <span class='lbrace'>{</span> <span class='op'>|</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_av'>av</span><span class='comma'>,</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_bv'>bv</span><span class='op'>|</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_av'>av</span> <span class='op'>+</span> <span class='id identifier rubyid_bv'>bv</span> <span class='rbrace'>}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Using the <code>dataflow</code> method you can build up a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tasks that depend on each other, and have the tasks run as soon as their dependencies are ready and there is CPU capacity to schedule them. This can help you create a program that uses more of the CPU resources available to you. </p>

<h3>Derivation</h3>

<p>This section describes how we could derive dataflow from other primitives in this library.</p>

<p>Consider a naive fibonacci calculator.</p>

<p>One of the drawbacks of this approach is that all the futures start, and then most of them immediately block on their dependencies. We know that there&#39;s no point executing those futures until their dependencies are ready, so let&#39;s not execute each future until all their dependencies are ready. </p>

<p>To do this we&#39;ll create an object that counts the number of times it observes a future finishing before it does something - and for us that something will be to execute the next future. </p>

<p>Since we know that the futures the dataflow computation depends on are already going to be available when the future is executed, we might as well pass the values into the block so we don&#39;t have to reference the futures inside the block. This allows us to write the dataflow block as straight non-concurrent code without reference to futures. </p>
