  # NOTE: These tests depend heavily on the private/undocumented
  # `ThreadLocalVar#value_for` method. This method does not, and cannot work
  # on JRuby at this time. Therefore, these tests cannot be run successfully on
  # JRuby. The initial implementation used a variation of `ThreadLocalVar`
  # which was pure-Ruby on all platforms and exhibited behavior that allowed
  # these tests to work. Functionality on JRuby was verified at that time. So
  # long as `ReentrantReadWriteLock` is not changed (with respect to
  # `ThreadLocalVar`) we can safely assume proper functionality on JRuby.
